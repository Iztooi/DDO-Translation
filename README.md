# DDO-Translation

UPDATE: Each xml file has an entry for the original japanese text encased in an &lt;original xml:space="preserve"&gt;&lt;/original&gt; tag. When entering in your translation simply press enter to make a new line and encase your translated text in a &lt;translation xml:space="preserve"&gt;&lt;/translation&gt; tag. If you are unsure of what this looks like please take a look at some files that have already been translated to see an example.

UPDATE: When doing translation please open up your own branch for your changes. When you feel that your edits are ready for review please open a pull request to have your branch merged into master. This lets people see your request, the changes it makes as well as allowing them to comment/feedback on it before merging. If you are unsure of how branching works please read the github wiki or other guides on git branching.
